Rinse Blue Soap Recipes and Ingredients

## Bar
  This makes a 1 pound (454 gram) batch with 5% superfat and 33% water reduction.

### Ingredients / Recipe
 - 62 grams   |  Sodium Hydroxide (Lye)
 - 124 grams  |  Distilled Water
 - 150 grams  |  Refined Coconut Oil
 - 25 grams   |  Shea Butter
 - 225 grams  |  Olive Oil
 - 100 grams  |  Sunflower Oil

### What tools we need:
  - Digital scale (this is important for making a soap that is not too harsh or too oily)
  - Glass jars and bowls
  - Stick blender 
  - Plastic cups (optional)
  - Metal spoon
  - Wooden spoon
  - Spatula
  - Soap molds (or an old cardboard box lined with parchment paper). I have green flower molds, red silicon rose molds and basic bar soap molds.
  - Gloves and sunglasses or eyewear
  - White vinegar for neutralizing the lye mixture if it spills on anything.

### What to do:
  1. Get all all of your ingredients and weigh them out to correct amounts. It is important to do this before you begin as soap making is a time sensitive process and there isn’t time to stop and measure in between.
  
  2. Combine liquid oils: olive oil and jojoba oil and set aside in a small jar or bowl.
  
  3. Melt coconut oil and shea butter in a small pan on the stove until just melted and set aside.

  4. Now you’ll need to carefully make the lye solution. Make sure pets and small children are not in the room and always wear goggles and waterproof gloves. Measure and weigh each separately first. Never use hot water when mixing and never ever add water to the lye. Mix by adding lye to room temperature or cool water in a sturdy glass container. Again, never add water to the lye! This mixture will get very hot and release steam at first. Stir with a stainless steel spoon until the lye is completely dissolved.

  5. Now is when your digital thermometer comes in handy. you’ll want to mix the oils and the lye mixture when they both reach 105 degrees. There can be a slight difference but the lye solution should be under 110 degrees and within 10 degrees of the oils temperature.

  6. Once the lye is mixed, combine the liquid oils into the melted butters and solids and stir to combine. Check the temperature. You’re aiming for 105 and might need to heat them back up slightly if they’ve cooled. You’ll mostly be waiting for the lye to cool to 105 so you can begin mixing (called bringing the soap to trace).

  7. Slowly and carefully, pour the lye mixture into the oils.

  8. Use an immersion blender to blend the soap until it reaches trace. This means the oils have saponified. Keep blending until it is creamy and like pudding. If you want to add essential oils or any other ingredients, this is the time you’ll add them. I usually add about a teaspoon of a gentle essential oil like lavender. Work really quickly so the soap doesn’t harden too much in this stage.

  9. Quickly transfer into molds and tap a few times to release air bubbles. I like to use individual silicone bar molds because they are easier.

  10. Insulate (or not). Insulating soap will lead to a darker and more transparent finished soap. Not insulating will result in a lighter and more opaque soap. I’ve insulated two ways: by carefully covering and wrapping in a towel, and my placing on a baking sheet and placing in a warm but cooled (110 degree) oven and leaving overnight.

  11. Wait two days and remove soap from the mold.

  12. Now for the patience… your soap needs to cure! It isn’t ready yet. Place on a flat and well ventilated area for 30 days. Turn it over a few times during this time period.

### How To Customize
  - Essential oils
  - Dried herbs (for texture or color)- my favorites are dried lavender flowers, chamomile flowers or calendula, though any dried her could be added.
  - Colors– natural color options I’ve tried are spices and plant materials like spirulina, turmeric, cocoa, ground coffee (my favorite), hibiscus, beet root and others.
  - Texture add ins– like dry freshly ground coffee, healing clays for silky clay soap, sea salt soap, oatmeal or any other ingredient.
